## Hi there, I'm Chris ðŸ‘‹
With a decade-long track record steering the helm of e-commerce and direct-to-consumer enterprises, I bring a wealth of expertise as a seasoned product manager. My journey has sculpted a unique fusion of marketing finesse and product leadershipâ€”an intricate dance between technical proficiency and an acute understanding of customer journeys. 

## Man of many passions 
You might say, I'm all over the place. Started in consumer. Landed in D2C. Went to school for business, and ended up on Github writing this `README.md`. 

I'm `technical`. âš¡Creativeâš¡. ðŸ¤”CuriousðŸ¤”. 

## Brick Enterprises LLC
My fancy LLC, that's home to all of my ideas. I'm a Shopify consultant on the side. I run Eagle Creek Security based in Eagle, ID. I *was* a partner at MSR Properties.
